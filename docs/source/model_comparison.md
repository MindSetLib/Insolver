# Model comparison
Insolver has a small tool, `ModelMetricsCompare` that allows comparing model metrics and prediction distributions for 
supervised learning algorithms.

`ModelMetricsCompare` calculates metrics and prediction statistics on a given dataset that are calculated based on
insolver models mentioned in the `source` argument. The source may be a list of models or a destination path to the folder 
with models.
